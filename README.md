## Simple resources for various types of Spark Clusters on docker and k8s environment

### Disclaimer

**Strongly discouraged to use these in your production environment!!**

Some of container resources are vulnerable since their security vulnerities are exposed in order to track them with profiler. I do not have any responsibilities of being attacked by using these resources directly.
